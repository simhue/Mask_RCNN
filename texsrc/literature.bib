abstract = {Summary Some 109tonnes of chlorophyll are destroyed each year on land and in the oceans. The fate of these chlorophylls is, however, largely unknown. This review describes the developmental stages at which chlorophyll breakdown occurs in aquatic and terrestrial biological systems, and the destruction arising from herbivory, disease, pollution and other physical hazards. At the cellular level, an attempt is made to separate the breakdown of chlorophyll during senescence from the many other events associated with cell destruction and death. A consideration of the more important chemical and biophysical properties of chlorophylls and their derivatives is provided, together with data on their spectral properties. The biosynthetic and biodegradative pathways of chlorophyll metabolism are, so far as is possible, described with some predictions as to the likely fate of the missing tonnes. Two types of degradation are recognized; the first involves up to five defined enzymes concerned with the early stages, the second covers the less well defined enzymic and non-enzymic destruction of the macrocyclic structure. These degradative reactions are compared with the reactions implicated in the breakdown of other porphyrins including haems in plants and animals. A brief description is given of the occurrence of breakdown products of chlorophyll in past biomass, including those of geological significance and those in a more recent archaeological context. Finally, the economic significance of chlorophyll breakdown is considered in the context of agriculture and horticulture, veterinary and medical sciences, food colouring and cosmetic industries, and the multi-million-dollar attraction of autumn leaf fall to tourism.}

Leaf chlorophyll content provides valuable information about physiological status of plants. Reflectance measurement makes it possible to quickly and non-destructively assess, in situ, the chlorophyll content in leaves. Our objective was to investigate the spectral behavior of the relationship between reflectance and chlorophyll content and to develop a technique for non-destructive chlorophyll estimation in leaves with a wide range of pigment content and composition using reflectance in a few broad spectral bands. Spectral reflectance of maple, chestnut, wild vine and beech leaves in a wide range of pigment content and composition was investigated. It was shown that reciprocal reflectance (R<)−1 in the spectral range λ from 520 to 550 nm and 695 to 705 nm related closely to the total chlorophyll content in leaves of all species. Subtraction of near infra-red reciprocal reflectance, (RNIR)−1, from (R<)−1 made index [(R<)−1-(RNIR)−1] linearly proportional to the total chlorophyll content in spectral ranges λ from 525 to 555 nm and from 695 to 725 nm with coefficient of determination r2 ≫ 0.94. To adjust for differences in leaf structure, the product of the latter index and NIR reflectance [(Rλ)−1-(RNIR)−1]*(RNIR) was used; this further increased the accuracy of the chlorophyll estimation in the range λ from 520 to 585 nm and from 695 to 740 nm. Two independent data sets were used to validate the developed algorithms. The root mean square error of the chlorophyll prediction did not exceed 50 μmol/m2 in leaves with total chlorophyll ranged from 1 to 830 μmol/m2."

abstract = "ESA's upcoming satellites Sentinel-2 (S2) and Sentinel-3 (S3) aim to ensure continuity for Landsat 5/7, SPOT-5, SPOT-Vegetation and Envisat MERIS observations by providing superspectral images of high spatial and temporal resolution. S2 and S3 will deliver near real-time operational products with a high accuracy for land monitoring. This unprecedented data availability leads to an urgent need for developing robust and accurate retrieval methods. Machine learning regression algorithms may be powerful candidates for the estimation of biophysical parameters from satellite reflectance measurements because of their ability to perform adaptive, nonlinear data fitting. By using data from the ESA-led field campaign SPARC (Barrax, Spain) we have compared the utility of four state-of-the-art machine learning regression algorithms and four different S2 and S3 band settings to assess three important biophysical parameters: leaf chlorophyll content (Chl), leaf area index (LAI) and fractional vegetation cover (FVC). The tested Sentinel configurations were: S2-10m (4 bands), S2-20m (8 bands), S2-60m (10 bands) and S3-300m (19 bands), and the tested methods were: neural networks (NN), support vector regression (SVR), kernel ridge regression (KRR), and Gaussian processes regression (GPR). GPR outperformed the other retrieval methods for the majority of tested configurations and was the only method that reached the 10% precision required by end users in the estimation of Chl. Also, although validated with an RMSE accuracy around 20%, GPR yielded optimal LAI and FVC estimates at highest S2 spatial resolution of 10m with only four bands. In addition to high accuracy values, GPR also provided confidence intervals of the estimates and insight in relevant bands, which are key advantages over the other methods. Given all this, GPR proved to be a fast and accurate nonlinear retrieval algorithm that can be potentially implemented for operational monitoring applications."

ABSTRACT = {Aerial imaging provides a landscape view of crop fields that can be utilized to monitor plant diseases. Phymatotrichopsis root rot (PRR) is a serious root rot disease affecting several dicotyledonous hosts, including the perennial forage crop alfalfa. PRR disease causes stand loss by spreading as circular to irregular diseased areas that increase over time, but disease progression in alfalfa fields is poorly understood. The objectives of this study were to develop a workflow to produce PRR disease maps from sets of high-resolution red, green and blue (RGB) images acquired from two different platforms and to assess the feasibility of using these PRR disease maps to monitor disease progression in alfalfa fields. Aerial RGB images, two from unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and four images from a manned aircraft platform were acquired at different time points during the 2014&ndash;2015 growing seasons from a center-pivot irrigated, PRR-infested alfalfa field near Burneyville, OK. Supervised classification of images acquired from both platforms were performed using three spectral signatures: image-specific, UAS-platform-specific and manned-aircraft platform-specific. Our results showed that the UAS-platform-specific spectral signature was most efficient for classifying images acquired with the UAS, with accuracy ranging from 90 to 96%. In contrast, manned-aircraft-acquired images classified using image-specific spectral signatures yielded 95 to 100% accuracy. The effect of hue, saturation and value color space transformations (HSV and Hrot60SV) on classification accuracy was determined, but the accuracy estimates showed no improvement in their efficiency compared to the RGB color space. Finally, the data showed that the classification of the bare ground increased by 74% during the study period, indicating the extent of alfalfa stand loss caused by PRR disease. Thus, this study showed the utility of high-resolution RGB aerial images for monitoring PRR disease spread in alfalfa.},
